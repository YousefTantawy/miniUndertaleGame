## Desc

This project is a Java-based recreation of the **Undyne battle** from the hit indie game **Undertale**, originally developed by Toby Fox. The game mimics the iconic fight mechanics, focusing on dodging projectiles and blocking attacks with directional shields — staying true to the fast-paced bullet-hell style gameplay.

Built with **Java Swing**, this version features real-time movement, basic collision detection, and dynamic projectile spawning.
